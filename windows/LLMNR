LLMNR (UDP/5355, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) is used in all Windows versions starting from Vista and allows IPv6 and IPv4 clients to resolve the names of neighboring computers without using DNS server due to broadcast requests in the local segment of L2 network. This protocol is automatically used if DNS is unavailable. So if there are DNS servers in the domain, this protocol is not needed.
