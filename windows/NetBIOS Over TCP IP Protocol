NetBIOS over TCP/IP or NBT-NS (UDP/137,138;TCP/139) is a broadcast protocol being a predecessor of LLMNR and used in the local network to publish and search for resources. By default, NetBIOS over TCP/IP support is enabled for all interfaces in all Windows versions.

Thus, these protocols enable the computers in the local network to find each other if DNS server is unavailable. They may be necessary in a workgroup, but in the domain network both of them may be disabled.
