1) Threat hunting windows DNS vulnerability 

Unusual child of dns.exe - Kibana Query Language (KQL)

The detection logic in Figure 1 (below) identifies suspicious or unexpected child processes spawned from the Windows DNS service (dns.exe). This activity may indicate activity related to remote code execution (RCE) or other forms of exploitation.

event.category:process and event.type:start and process.parent.name:dns.exe and not process.name:conhost.exe


2) Network (Packetbeat and Filebeat with the Zeek or Suricata modules)

As detailed in the Check Point SIGRed research, abnormally large DNS responses can cause the heap-based buffer overflow scenario. The logic in Figure 3 (below) identifies large DNS responses using either Packetbeat or Filebeat (with Zeek or Suricata modules enabled).

event.category:(network or network_traffic) and destination.port:53 and (event.dataset:zeek.dns or type:dns or event.type:connection) and network.bytes>60000
